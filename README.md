# Web based code tools and examples
# Flask Call Python Via Ajax
Code in web/flask
- Install Flask
  - pip install flask
  - After creating app.py
- python app.py 
  - Works becasue app.py runs flask
- app.py and templates/json.html allow a button to be created which
  prints hello on the terminal you started app.py
- app.py uses more features and an Ajax method to call python code
- json2.py is a second similar way to call python from buttons but looks a little easier
