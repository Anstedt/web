# Anvil Sense Hat
Access to my SenseHat Uplink app via any browser
	https://zmm23x4xtkgc7ogh.anvil.app/EJDWYASHHUWKX7EOQFTUWUKZ
	
Run show.py from command line or Thonny

The Anvil app and the show.py RP app both use the link key
"A4SECVZIGE77VCRMHU7KQKG3-ZMM23X4XTKGC7OGH" which is created from within the
Anvil app editor

I gave Anvil my public key for Git from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

/opt/git/Uplink was cloned using:
git clone ssh://anstedt@gmail.com@anvil.works:2222/ZMM23X4XTKGC7OGH.git Uplink
